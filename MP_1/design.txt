The general design I have for this is I will have the server create a socket and listen on it for connections as well as potential messages sent.
Those sent messages get put through a handler which will output the status of the command that was sent which is put into the reply struct to be sent back to the client
For when the CREATE message is sent I will be forking the process and storing the PID of the child so that whenever the DELETE command is sent I can send a kill signal to the child to end the room.
For the child it will have a similar structure to main and will have a message handler that will send the messages recieved to all other clients that are connected.
